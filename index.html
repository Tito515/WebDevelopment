        <h3>THE STATE'S LATEST CONSERVATION EFFORTS ARE BEING HERALDED BY NATION'S TOP LEADERS AS GROUNDBREAKING AND
            FORWARD THINKING.</h3>
        <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: JAMES JAYCE</span>
        <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of real estate
            developers. Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters. Currently, the
            Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is
            regulating construction along the shoreline and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent
            decisions. These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront
            Homeowners Association.</p>

        <p>The League to Save Lake Tahoe (Keep Tahoe Blue) has been an environmental watchdog in the Lake Tahoe Basin
            for 50 years. Founded when a proposal to build a four-lane highway around the lake (with a bridge over the
            entrance to Emerald Bay) was
            proposed in 1957, the League has thwarted poorly designed development projects and environmentally unsound
            planning. The League embraces responsible and diversified use of the Lake's resources while protecting and
            restoring its natural attributes.</p>

        <div class="pull-quote">
            <h2>"THE LEAGUE EMBRACES RESPONSIBLE AND DIVERSIFIED USE OF THE LAKE'S RESOURCES WHILE PROTECTING AND
                RESTORING ITS NATURAL ATTRIBUTES"</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Since 1980, the Lake Tahoe Interagency Monitoring Program (LTIMP) has been measuring stream discharge and
            concentrations of nutrients and sediment in up to 10 tributary streams in the Lake Tahoe Basin,
            California-Nevada. The objectives of the
            LTIMP are to acquire and disseminate the water quality information necessary to support science-based
            environmental planning and decision making in the basin. The LTIMP is a cooperative program with support
            from 12 federal and state agencies
            with interests in the Tahoe Basin. This data set, together with more recently acquired data on urban runoff
            water quality, is being used by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board to develop a program
            (mandated by the Clean Water
            Act) to limit the flux of nutrients and fine sediment to the Lake.</p>

        <p>UC Davis remains a primary steward of the lake. The UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center is dedicated
            to research, education and public outreach, and to providing objective scientific information for
            restoration and sustainable use of
            the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each year, it produces a well-publicized "State of the Lake" assessment report.</p>

        <h1>How the Rise of Soccer in the US Is Changing the Face of Youth Sports</h1>
        <h2>The focus on soccer in youth sports programs is exploding nation-wide</h2>
        <p>When the first World Cup arrived in the US in the 90's everyone officially declared that soccer was it. Well
            it's taken it's time but we can definitely see the influence of soccer, especially women's soccer, across
            the US. This year, 3 million
            kids played in youth soccer leagues with 2/3 of those leagues for girls. In fact, in the 12-17 age range the
            MLS has surpassed the MLB and NFL in popularity.</p>
        <p>Part of this meteoric rise can be attributed to the impressively soaring ad dollars being pumped into the
            Women's World Cup games in 2014. The women's games generated $40 million for Fox, that's definitely not
            chump change. And those advertisers,
            like ATT, Coca Cola, Verizon, Nike, Visa, and other heavy hitters, are working to make sure they see those
            numbers grow year after year by investing in youth soccer facilities and promoting programs across the
            country. </p>
        <p>Now that big business is involved you can be assured you'll see a continued rise in popularity in soccer
            across the country for years to come. </p>

    <p>The world is full of fascinating places. Planning the perfect vacation involves packing up, leaving home, and
        experiencing something new.</p>

    <h2 class='destination heading-background'>1. Florence, Italy</h2>
    <div class='description'>A city-size shrine to the Renaissance, Florence offers frescoes, sculptures, churches,
        palaces, and other monuments from the richest cultural flowering the world has known. Names from its dazzling
        historical past; Dante, Michelangelo, Galileo, Machiavelliare
        are some of the most resonant of the medieval age. <a

    <h2 class='destination heading-background'>2. Beijing, China</h2>
    <div class='description'>A city in the midst of reinventing itself and continuing to build on the success of the
        2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing is a place of frenzied construction. New housing, new roads, and new sports venues
        seem to spring up overnight. At the same time,
        the capital of the Peoples Republic of China remains an epicenter of tradition, with the treasures of nearly
        2,000 years as the imperial capital still on view in the famed Forbidden City and in the luxuriant pavilions and
        gardens of the Summer
        Palace.

    <h2 class='destination heading-background'>3. Seoul, South Korea</h2>
    <div class='description'>The Korean capital is a city of contrasts. Fourteenth-century city gates squat in the
        shadow of 21st-century skyscrapers, while the broad Han River is back-dropped by granite mountains rising in the
        city center complete with alpine highways speeding
        around their contours and temples nestling among their crags. Fashionable, gadget-laden youths battle for
        sidewalk space with fortune-tellers and peddlers, while tiny neighborhoods of traditional cottages contrast with
        endless ranks of identical
        apartments.
